# Moodle styles

## Bootstrap & Ionic
Moodle uses the Bootstrap framework in the browser and the Ionic framework in the app. When Bootstrap styles are used, they are often not displayed in the app or are displayed incorrectly.

One solution is to hide the Bootstrap elements in the app with the class `.ion-hide` and to use different elements for the app, which are then hidden in the browser with the class `.d-none`.

However, it is also possible to combine both frameworks. Components for this are listed here.
